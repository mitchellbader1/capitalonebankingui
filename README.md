# Capital One Banking UI

This project allows for basic banking control on the Capital One Nessie API, including new user and account creation, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, loan applications, and viewing account info.

To use, make sure Conan Package Manager is able to import the CPR library (needed to create HTTP requests to the API).
